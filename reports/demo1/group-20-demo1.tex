\begin{abstract} 
The abstract should consist of one sentence describing the intended functionality of your system, followed by a few sentences (100--200 words) summarising the key advances made for this demo. This should give the reader a clear expectation of what will be demonstrated.
\end{abstract} 


\section{Project plan update} 

This section should start with your goals:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Mapping House - Not achieved
    \item Forklift Design - Achieved 
    \item Cubby Design - ??
    \item Tray Design - ??
\end{itemize}

We have encountered issues with the mapping of the hosue enviroment, this is due to problems we have faced with the SLAM abilities of the turtlebots. 
It appears currently that we will not be able to automate the mapping process using ROS, so we are instead going to manually draw up the maps of the demo room.
The issue with the mapping software is due to the control software requiring a specific version of Ubuntu, which has proved infeasible to run in a virtual machine on DICE.

%Concisely summarise the reasons for any deviations from achievement of your intended goals.

%Provide a one paragraph description of how your group organised the work towards the goals, including specific indication of which group member worked on which aspect(s). Highlight any methods used to ensure effective group work such as protocols for code integration, task tracking, automated testing, etc.

%Provide a summary of how your budget has been spent so far.

%Provide a clear statement of any modification (relative to your original plan) that you wish to make to your goals for the next demonstration.

\section{Technical details}

This section should describe in technical terms the current status of your system implementation. It should provide clear justification for any design decisions, with brief reference to any alternatives considered or explored. If your implementation is based on the work of others (e.g. you have found a specific vision processing algorithm) you should cite the source (e.g. \cite{Newell81}) and add the details to the example-refs.bib file so that the full reference appears in the bibliography section. Note you can also refer back to your own previous reports. 

You can export references in the bibtex format from Google Scholar. Click the quotation marks underneath the study name, click 'Bibtex' in the new popup. You can then copy and paste this code into example-refs.bib.

The following are some suggested subsections. You might also want to include a system overview diagram showing how all the relevant parts connect. 

\subsection{Hardware}

Explain any construction on the hardware parts of your system, including choice and placement of sensors and actuators. Pictures should be used if appropriate (for instance, figure~\ref{fig:sample-fig}), using the \verb+\includegraphics+ environment to include an image (pdf, png, or jpg formats), ideally with informative labels added. 

To keep your folders clean, it is often a good idea to keep your images in a separate folder. In this example, we've put the figures in the \texttt{figs/} folder. To include images from different folders, give the relative path from this file. Example: \verb+\includegraphics{figs/image_filename}+.

%\begin{figure}[tb]

%\begin{center}
%\centerline{\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figs/crane}}
%\caption{Lego construction: highlight any salient features in the caption}
%\label{fig:sample-fig}
%\end{center}
%\vskip -5mm
%\end{figure} 

\subsection{User interface}

Depending on your system and its stage of development, it could be useful to include a section about the user interface design, and the usability decisions behind it. Note, however, that you will be asked to provide a separate 'user guide' for the final demo.

\subsection{Software}

%Explain the key details of the control and interface software developed for the project. Be clear about any packages used and the reason for choosing them. 

%If you present algorithms, you can use the \verb+algorithm+ and \verb+algorithmic+ environments to format pseudocode (for instance, Algorithm~\ref{alg:example}). These require the corresponding style files, \verb+algorithm.sty+ and \verb+algorithmic.sty+ which are supplied with this package. 

Turtlebot movement is currently using a method based upon predefined paths which it is able to follow. 
To ensure that turtlebot is moving the correct distances we are using feedback from the odomoter to determine how far the turtlebot has travelled.
To gather odomoter feedback we are using the ROS data feeds, as these are already implemented for the turtlebot and fairly accurate.
We are currently using predefined paths to allow us to test that the movement of the turtlebot is working as expected. In future we expect to be able to generate these paths based on a predefined map and a start and finish location.

We considered using the ROS navigation stack, however it was proving difficult to implement due to a lack of the control software on DICE and missing libraries on the turtlebot. 
Based on this, and the advice of one of the SDP experts we have decided to use our own navigation implementation.

\begin{algorithm}[ht]
\begin{algorithmic}
   \STATE {\bfseries Input:} data $x_i$, size $m$
   \REPEAT
   \STATE Initialize $noChange = true$.
   \FOR{$i=1$ {\bfseries to} $m-1$}
   \IF{$x_i > x_{i+1}$} 
   \STATE Swap $x_i$ and $x_{i+1}$
   \STATE $noChange = false$
   \ENDIF
   \ENDFOR
   \UNTIL{$noChange$ is $true$}
\end{algorithmic}
  \caption{Bubble Sort}
  \label{alg:example}
\end{algorithm}

\section{Evaluation}

This section should first outline any testing methods you used (e.g. repeated runs of subsystems, data-logging, naive user testing). 

It should then present relevant quantitative results. If you are using graphs, please make sure they are properly labelled and logically illustrate the point you want to make (e.g. to compare two algorithms).

At an absolute minimum, this section should provide a table (for instance, table~\ref{tab:sample-table}, using the \verb+table+ environment) of success rates for repeated runs of the whole system (as you will only be able to show one run in the demo).

\begin{table}[h]
\vskip 3mm
\begin{center}
\begin{small}
\begin{sc}
\begin{tabular}{lcccr}
\hline
\abovespace\belowspace
Test  & Time(mins) & Errors & Success \\
\hline
\abovespace
1    & 1:30 & 0 & $\surd$ \\
2    & 3:00 & 2 & $\times$\\
3    & 2:20 & 1 & $\surd$ \\
4    & 1:50 & 1 & $\times$\\
\belowspace
5    & 2:10 & 0 & $\surd$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{sc}
\end{small}
\caption{Results for 5 tests of the system.}
\label{tab:sample-table}
\end{center}
\vskip -3mm
\end{table}

If you need a figure or table to stretch across two columns use the \verb+figure*+ or \verb+table*+ environment instead of the \verb+figure+ or \verb+table+ environment.  Use the \verb+subfigure+ environment if you want to include multiple graphics in a single figure.

\section{Budget}
Each report should contain an actualization of the estimated total budget 
of your system.
